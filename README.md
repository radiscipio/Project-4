## Description

Barry's is a men's grooming website based on Harrys.com. We sell quality razors, shaving cream, and other grooming needs. These products sold by other companies are inflated for resellers and sold at a much higher cost, but at Barry's you get the products right from us, no middleman required.

## API Info
I have two API's seeding into the project. One is user made, by registering themselves on the website, and the other are the products displayed on the site.


## MVP/ Post MVP

#### MVP
- All main components (Main (Home), Products, Profile, Cart, Help, Header, and Footer)
-  Working flow of a functional website (minus actually paying for products.
- Working shopping cart for users to edit their items, but not delete from the database
- Full CRUD to create, read, update, and delete a signed up user, and their information. 


#### Post MVP
- Add in more components to mirror Harrys.com, and give the feel of an actual business
- Saving user shipping info
- Add filters to the products
- Add in more variety of products
